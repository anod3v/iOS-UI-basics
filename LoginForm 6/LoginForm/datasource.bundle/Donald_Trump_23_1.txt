Trump has often said he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.[64] In October 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump "was a millionaire by age 8", borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to reimburse him, and had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime.[65][66] According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied. The tax department of New York said it is "vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation" into it.[67][68] Analyses by The Economist and The Washington Post have concluded that Trump's investments underperformed the stock market.[69][70] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that the value of Trump's personal brand licensing business had declined by 88% since 2015, to $3 million.[71]
