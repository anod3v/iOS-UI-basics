Letov's older brother is the famous free jazz saxophonist Sergey Letov.

In the late 1980s, Letov was close with Yanka Dyagileva, though it's not clear whether they were partners or not. He was married to Anna Volkova in the 1990s and to Natalia Chumakova from 1998 until his death. Letov had no children, as he and Chumakova both had childfree views.[citation needed]

Letov was an open LSD, marijuana, and psilocybin mushroom user. He also was a heavy alcohol drinker, which may have led to his premature death.
