In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[63] Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple's QuickTime who had hired Musk, noted: "He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out."[47]:60

In 1995, Musk was accepted to a PhD program in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California.[23] Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, however, he decided to instead launch his first company, Zip2.
