The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[79] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[80] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that[by whom?], in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[81][better source needed] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.[82]
