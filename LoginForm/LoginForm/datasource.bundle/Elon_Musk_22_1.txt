Starting in 2011, SpaceX received funding under NASA's Commercial Crew Development program, to develop the SpaceX Dragon 2 crew capsule.[93] A contract to provide crew flights to the ISS was awarded in 2014.[94]

Musk believed the key to making space travel affordable was to make rockets reusable, though space industry experts[who?] believed reusable rockets were impossible or infeasible.[95][full citation needed] On December 22, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of its Falcon rocket back at the launch pad, the first time this had been achieved by an orbital rocket.[96] The first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform,[97] and by the end of 2017, SpaceX had landed and recovered the first stage on 16 consecutive missions where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. Twenty out of 42 first stage Falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the Falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010.[98]
