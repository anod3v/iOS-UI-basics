On May 30, 2020, SpaceX launched its first manned flight called Demo-2 becoming the first private company to both place a person into orbit and to eventually dock a manned space-craft with the ISS.[120] Further, the launch was the first time since the end of the Shuttle Program that an American Astronaut has been launched from American soil on an American rocket.[121]

During discourse with his peers when the technology of SpaceX was criticized or had the potential to cause fatalities, Elon Musk has described himself as the company's responsible chief engineer/designer, while giving the entire team at SpaceX credit for its success.[122][123]
